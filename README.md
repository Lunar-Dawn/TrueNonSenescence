# True Non-Sensescence

Tired of your multi-centennial elves dying of plague, your dragons being incapable of giving birth, or the fact that a 600-year old couldn't possibly be in a relationship with a 620-year old?

When Ludeon made the Non-Senescent gene it was specifically designed with Sanguophages in mind.
Unfortunately they also have the Ageless gene and thus vanilla pawns never really have a 3-digit biological age.
Because of that they missed a few areas where a Non-Senescent pawn's biological age still matters.

- Immunity gain speed falls to 50% after 120 years of age.
- Fertility falls to 0% at 50 years for women, and at 90 years for men.
- Romance carries a heavy penalty based on the absolute age gap.
- On their birthdays, Non-Senescent pawns can still get hearing loss.

This small mod patches all these issues, letting you have your venerably old pawns just workâ„¢.
